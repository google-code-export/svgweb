This page documents how to configure your web server to add support for both HTC and SWF files. Feel free to edit this page if you have knowledge on how to do this for your particular web server environment.

   * You can drop an [http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess.shtml .htaccess] file into the directory where the svg.htc and svg.swf files are located. This file would consist of the following:

{{{
AddType text/x-component htc
AddType application/x-shockwave-flash swf
AddType image/svg+xml svg
}}}

application/x-shockwave-flash swf
image/svg+xml svg
